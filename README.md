# Getting Started with the .NET MAUI Circular Chart Control
Syncfusion .NET MAUI Charts (SfCircularChart) is used to create the chart with beautiful and enhanced UI visualization of data that are used in high-quality .NET MAUI applications.
* **Chart types** - Supports two types of series such as pie and doughnut. Each series presents data in a unique way and it is designed to be more user-friendly.

* **User interaction** - The circular chart selection, tooltips, and explode user interaction features significantly improves the end-user experience.

* **Legends** - Display additional information about the data points of chart series.

* **Dynamic update** - Updates the chart dynamically or lazily with live data that changes over seconds or minutes.
  
A quick start .NET MAUI project that shows how to create and configure the Syncfusion MAUI Circular Chart. This project also includes a code snippet to bind data objects to it, explode each segment, customize selection behavior, render doughnut chart type, and enable a few of its interactive features like data labels, legends, and tooltips.
